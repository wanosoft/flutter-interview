# flutterinterview  
  
A Flutter app for interviewing.  
  
## What to do  
 - Create an app that display data from an API request.  
   - When the app starts, it will make a GET request to the [JSON placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1/todos) to retrieve a user's todos.  
   - Once retrieved, you will display the response in a view (an image of this UI is included in the repository under the name `mockup.png`).  
   - The user is also able to refresh the button by clicking on the refresh icon in the toolbar.  
  
- Please feel free to use any architectures and packages, but be mindful of the time constraint of the interview.
